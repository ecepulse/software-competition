# ECE Pulse Software Competition

## Data Structures Competition

### Level 1

If you had to store your grocery list in an array or a linked-list, which one would you use? Write down your answer in the provided .txt.

### Level 2

Complete the skeletal file to detect if the linked list loops back on itself. You unfortunately can not do this in another language than C.

### Level 3

Implement a dictionary data structure that maps integers to strings with standard CRUD operations. For this user, it's better for reads to be as fast as possible than creation, updating, or deleting.

You may decide the interface and language for your dictionary, but you must provided a .txt of how we can test it. You may not use external libraries except those needed for string reading.

### Level 4

Complete level 3 with a hash table, the catch is you must design the hash function! Your hash function should be deterministic and follow SUHA. You should try to avoid predictable collisions, and you're hash table needs to have a collision resolution strategy.
